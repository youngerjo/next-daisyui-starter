# Next DaisyUI Starter

A minimal web starter project based on Next.js, TailwindCSS and daisyUI

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)

## Installation

I personally recommend using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the bundler/package manager. To install Bun, run the following bash script:

```
$ curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Once Bun is successfully installed, you can use it just like any other package manager (e.g. npm or yarn):

```
$ bun install
```

## Run

```
$ bun dev
```
